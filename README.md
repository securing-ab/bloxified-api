# Bloxified

## **This is the package which will allow you to contact the Bloxified API for reasons like Social Integrations, or a simple Discord bot.** 

**NB:** *The stable branch of this package only interacts with V1 of the API until Bloxified has rolled out V2 of the API to the stable branch.*

# Installation Process

```
npm i bloxified --save
```
